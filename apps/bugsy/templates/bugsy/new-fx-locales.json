    "comment": "This is a tracker bug for releasing Firefox {{ loc }}.\n\nYour team's dashboard should be up on http://l10n.mozilla.org/teams/{{ loc }}. The dashboard displays your project's status and helps you (and us) determine what's left to do. Follow it closely to track your Firefox localization progress. You will see this bug listed as part of your dashboard. This helps us to track your project's progress and provide visibility to your work.\n\nThe \"bugs\" here are tracking individual items of work. Some of those will depend on the localization team driving them to completion, while others are for infrastructure that will be handled by Mozilla staff. I'll indicate who is responsible in each bug.\n\nWe'll also be using two terms for interacting with version control. That's commonly mercurial, or hg, in short. \"commit\" is used when talking about the actual 'hg commit' command, adding changes to the local version history. \"landing\" means to commit something and to use 'hg push' to push it from your local version history to the one on hg.mozilla.org, mozilla's server. That's when your changes are public, and make it into the builds Mozilla generates, and puts on ftp.\n\nIf you're unsure what any of the terminology means, feel free to ask. Good places are http://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/#dev-l10n-new-locales or #l10n. Ask in public, you shouldn't assume that you're the only one with the question.",

The guidelines for making recommendations are found on <https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Firefox/Productization>. \n\nWe currently use this set for en-US, to which we can fall back in the case of lacking localized alternatives:\nGoogle, Bing, Amazon, DuckDuckGo, Twitter, Wikipedia, eBay\n\nAdding brand new search engines, that not yet ship in any other language, needs approval from Business Development and requires more time to get authorization and assets from the provider. To avoid blocking the initial set up, this type of requests should be split into follow up bugs. {{ name }}, we'll likely need your help to at least get the owner's contact information.\n\nOnce we have a specification on what the search engines for {{ language }} should look like, flod and the localization team will work on an implementation on that. flod will create and attach patches for the desired changes and get them reviewed. After a successful review, flod will land them. {{ name }}, if you're interested, you could create the patches, too. You'd ask flod for review on those before landing.\n\nPlease don't commit any modifications in browser/searchplugins to the hg repository without a patch reviewed by flod, Stas, Axel or someone else appointed by flod.
